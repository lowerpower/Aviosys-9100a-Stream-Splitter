# Aviosys-9100a-Stream-Splitter

This is a hack that is used in the Yoics firmware for the Aviosys 9100a firmware to split the multi-camera, multi-part jpg stream into seperate jpg images in /tmp so they can be used with a regular browser interface.

It assumes you have the correct build tools installed for the ARM uclinux tools for this platform.
